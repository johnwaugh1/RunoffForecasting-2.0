# RunoffForecasting-2.0

This project aims to fix a previous project in which I used an LSTM network to improve the accuracy of the National Water Model (NWM) Runoff Forecasts. 

In this updated project I plan to train a separate model for each USGS station, and also use a few different models for each station, like LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers.
